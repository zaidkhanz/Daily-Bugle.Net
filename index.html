                                After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020,
                                PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive
                                digital assets between PayPal and other wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the
                                feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible
                                U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin
                                <b>BTC</b> <span class="text-success fw-bold">$16,704</span> Ether

                                In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via Checkout
                                at millions of merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the
                                New York Department of Financial Services for the conduct.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-4"> Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter
                                the crypto section of the application to start transferring coins. Users are generally
                                required to complete a one-time ID verification before the procedure.</p>

                            <p class="fs-4">
                                Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on
                                their respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such
                                fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each
                                transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming
                                transfers,
                            </p>

                                The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as
                                central bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring
                                the possibility of launching its own stable coin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery
                                came after a developer found evidence of such a stable coin within the source code of
                                the company's iPhone app.

                                Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward spiral
                                alongside other cryptocurrencies. The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major effect
                                on the income and profits of miners. Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue in 2022
                                seems like a large number, it is comparatively lower than that of 2021.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-4">
                                Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more than $15 billion in revenue, according
                                to the data from the block. This was actually considered to be a 206% year-over-year
                                increase.
